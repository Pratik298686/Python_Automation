The provided Python script, "organize_files.py," is designed to organize files from a source folder into subfolders based on their file extensions and move them to a specified destination folder. Here's a summary of its functionality:

1. It defines a dictionary named file_extension_mapping to map file extensions to their respective folders. For example, image files (.jpg, .png, .jpeg, .gif) are mapped to the "Images" folder, document files (.pdf, .doc, .docx, .txt) to the "Documents" folder, and video files (.mp4, .avi, .mkv, .mov) to the "Videos" folder.

2. The organize_files function takes two arguments: source_folder and destination_folder. It iterates through the files in the source folder and checks their file extensions. If the file extension is found in the file_extension_mapping, it moves the file to the corresponding subfolder in the destination folder.

3. The main function is responsible for parsing command-line arguments. It expects two command-line arguments: the source folder and the destination folder. If the correct number of arguments is not provided, it displays a usage message and exits with an error code.

4. Inside the main function, it attempts to execute the organize_files function, catching and displaying any exceptions that may occur during the process.

Finally, the script is executed when the file is run directly. It checks if the current script is the main module and calls the main function accordingly.

To use this script, you would run it from the command line, providing the source folder and destination folder as arguments, like this:

python organize_files.py source_folder destination_folder

It will then organize the files in the source folder into subfolders based on their file extensions and move them to the destination folder as specified in the 'file_extension_mapping' dictionary.
